Hi reader! 
Let's explain this project. 
This is a part of the project that I made during the course for Junior Data Engineer with my team. The purpose of the project is to analize the NEET phenomenon in Italy (neet= Not in Education,Employment or Training). 
In particular, we analized this phenomenon by correlating different variables; in the first case we referred to a correlation between the sex of young NEETs and the territory in which they are located.
In the second case we referred to the analysis of a correlation between the age of the NEETs and the Italian regions.
Unfortnately, the dataset that we found had differen errors and time jumps. We tried to clean it as best we could and analyze only the data that could be cross-referenced.
-There are three files about the webpage created with pycharm that show you the codes of the controller,index and the style. 
- The file called "neet" shows you the database created on phpMyadmin.
- There is a file called "project_work_TEAM1" to show the PowerBI visualization.
